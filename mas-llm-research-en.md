## Introduction

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Large Language Models (LLM) represent two cutting-edge technologies in the field of artificial intelligence that have demonstrated significant progress in recent years. The integration of these technologies opens new horizons for creating intelligent systems capable of collectively solving complex problems.

Multi-Agent Systems consist of a collection of autonomous agents interacting with each other and their environment to achieve common or individual goals. Large Language Models, in turn, demonstrate impressive capabilities in natural language understanding, text generation, reasoning, and decision-making.

This research is devoted to analyzing methods, approaches, and prospects for creating multi-agent systems based on large language models. We will examine the key principles for building such systems, existing architectures, methods of communication and coordination between agents, as well as applications and challenges in this field.

## Fundamentals of Multi-Agent Systems

### Definition and Characteristics

A Multi-Agent System (MAS) is a system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. Key characteristics of multi-agent systems include:

1. **Autonomy**: agents function without direct human intervention and have a certain level of control over their actions.
2. **Social activity**: agents interact with each other through communication protocols.
3. **Reactivity**: agents perceive their environment and respond to changes within it.
4. **Proactivity**: agents are capable of exhibiting goal-directed behavior.
5. **Adaptivity**: agents can adapt to changing conditions and requirements.

### Historical Development of MAS

Research in the field of multi-agent systems began in the late 1980s as an extension of distributed artificial intelligence. Over time, MAS evolved from simple models to complex systems with various paradigms, including:

- **Reactive agents**: function on the principle of "stimulus-response."
- **Cognitive agents**: possess internal models of the world and can plan their actions.
- **Hybrid agents**: combine reactive and cognitive approaches.
- **Social agents**: emphasize social interactions and group behavior.

### Application Areas of MAS

Traditionally, multi-agent systems have been applied in areas such as:

- Robotics and automation
- Resource management and logistics
- Modeling of social and economic systems
- Distributed problem solving
- Computer games and simulations
- Smart cities and intelligent transportation systems

## Large Language Models (LLM): Overview

### Definition and Evolution

Large Language Models are neural networks trained on vast amounts of textual data to model natural language. The evolution of LLMs includes several generations:

1. **Early models** (Word2Vec, GloVe) — static vector representations of words.
2. **Recurrent Neural Network-based models** (LSTM, GRU) — account for the sequential nature of text.
3. **Attention mechanism-based models** (Transformer) — allow for modeling relationships between different elements in a sequence.
4. **Pre-trained models** (BERT, GPT, T5) — trained on large text corpora and then fine-tuned for specific tasks.
5. **Ultra-large models** (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) — scaling up model size and training data volume.

### Key Capabilities of LLMs

Modern large language models possess a range of impressive capabilities:

- **Understanding and generating natural language**
- **Context understanding** in long text sequences
- **Knowledge generalization** acquired during training
- **Reasoning** about complex concepts
- **Problem-solving** requiring the application of knowledge from various domains
- **Adaptation to new tasks** with minimal examples (few-shot learning)
- **Following instructions** and adapting to user preferences

### Principles of LLM Operation

Modern LLMs are based on the Transformer architecture, which uses a self-attention mechanism to model relationships between elements in a sequence. Training such models occurs in several stages:

1. **Pre-training** on large volumes of unlabeled data.
2. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback** (RLHF) to improve usefulness and safety.
3. **Alignment** to correspond with human values and preferences.

## Integration of LLMs into Multi-Agent Systems

### Conceptual Foundations

The integration of LLMs into multi-agent systems represents a new approach to creating intelligent agents. In such a system, each agent is either an instance of an LLM or uses an LLM as its "cognitive core." This allows agents to:

- Process natural language for interaction with each other and with humans
- Utilize common knowledge embedded in the language model
- Reason about complex situations and make decisions
- Adapt to new conditions without retraining

### Types of LLM-based Agents

1. **Autonomous LLM-agents**: act independently to achieve specific goals
2. **Specialized LLM-agents**: focus on certain aspects or tasks
3. **Coordination LLM-agents**: manage interaction between other agents
4. **Hybrid agents**: combine LLMs with other types of AI (e.g., rule-based systems, machine learning, etc.)

### Advantages of LLM-agents

Using LLMs as a foundation for agents in MAS provides several significant advantages:

- **Language interface**: a natural way of interaction between agents and with humans
- **Generalizability**: ability to apply knowledge to new situations
- **Extensive prior knowledge**: information acquired during pre-training
- **Flexibility**: adaptation to various domains and tasks
- **Scalability**: capability to be used for tasks ranging from simple to complex

## LLM-Agent Architectures

### Core Components of an LLM-Agent

A typical architecture of an LLM-based agent includes the following components:

1. **LLM Core**: the language model responsible for processing information and decision-making
2. **Memory**: a system for storing context, interaction history, and knowledge
3. **Planner**: a module for developing and executing plans
4. **Tools**: external modules for performing specific actions (e.g., web search, calculations)
5. **Observation mechanism**: interface for perceiving the environment
6. **Communication module**: interface for interacting with other agents
7. **Profile and goals**: definition of agent characteristics and objectives

### Modern Architectural Approaches

#### ReAct (Reason + Act)

The ReAct approach combines reasoning and action into a unified process. The agent:
1. Perceives the current state
2. Reasons about possible actions
3. Selects and performs an action
4. Observes the result
5. Updates its understanding of the situation

#### Reflexion

The Reflexion architecture adds a self-reflection component that allows the agent to analyze its past decisions and improve future actions:
1. Action: performing the task
2. Reflection: analyzing the result and process
3. Improvement: adjusting strategy based on reflection

#### LLM-Agent-Memory (RAM, Persistent, Episodic)

Architectures with different types of memory:
1. **RAM (short-term memory)**: for the current context
2. **Persistent (long-term memory)**: for storing important information between sessions
3. **Episodic (episodic memory)**: for remembering specific events and interactions

#### Task-Specific and Generalist Agents

1. **Task-Specific**: optimized for specific tasks or domains
2. **Generalist**: capable of solving a wide range of tasks, switching between roles

### Decision-Making Mechanisms

- **Chain-of-Thought**: step-by-step reasoning for decision-making
- **Tree of Thoughts**: exploration of multiple reasoning paths
- **Recursive Reasoning**: recursive refinement of reasoning
- **Tool-Augmented Reasoning**: use of external tools to improve the decision-making process

## Communication Between LLM-Agents

### Communication Protocols

Communication between LLM-agents can be carried out in various ways:

1. **Text-based communication**: exchange of messages in natural language
2. **Structured communication**: use of predefined formats (JSON, XML)
3. **Mixed communication**: combination of natural language and structured data

### Dialog Models Between Agents

- **Peer-to-Peer**: direct interaction between agents
- **Broadcast**: sending messages to all agents in the system

### Communication Challenges and Solutions

1. **Language ambiguity**: use of clarifications and context
2. **Different representations**: alignment of ontologies and terminology
3. **Context limitations**: mechanisms for compressing and prioritizing information
4. **Confidentiality**: protocols for secure information exchange

## Coordination and Decision-Making Algorithms

### Centralized Coordination

- **Supervisory agents**: special agents responsible for coordinating the actions of other agents
- **Task orchestration**: distribution and control of task execution
- **Hierarchical planning**: decomposition of tasks into subtasks with assignment of responsible agents

### Decentralized Coordination

- **Self-organization**: agents coordinate actions without central control
- **Auction mechanisms**: distribution of tasks based on bidding
- **Coalition formation**: creating groups of agents to solve specific tasks
- **Peer-to-peer protocols**: direct interaction between agents

### Collective Decision-Making

- **Voting**: making decisions based on agent preferences
- **Consensus protocols**: reaching agreement between agents
- **Argumentation**: exchange of arguments for decision-making
- **Collective learning**: improving decisions based on group experience
